# Instructions for Developing the Basic Survival Game

## Suggested Approach Using C++

### 1. Game Engine

- Use a game engine that supports C++ for faster development:
  - **Unreal Engine**: Excellent for 3D games, provides procedural generation tools, and supports advanced mechanics like complex building and AI.
  - **Godot Engine** (with C++ modules): Lightweight and open-source, suitable for voxel-based games.
  - **Custom Engine**: If you want full control, you can build your own engine using libraries like OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX, but this is more time-intensive.

### 2. Procedural Generation

- Use **Perlin Noise** or **Simplex Noise** for terrain generation.
- Implement a chunk-based system for voxel data storage and rendering.
- Libraries like **FastNoise** or **libnoise** can simplify noise generation.

### 3. Voxel Rendering

- Use a voxel rendering library like **PolyVox** or implement your own voxel renderer using **OpenGL** or **Vulkan**.
- Optimize rendering with techniques like **greedy meshing** or **chunk-based rendering** to improve performance.

### 4. Game Mechanics

- **Technology and Sorcery**: Use a modular system to allow players to choose between tech and magic paths. For example:
  - Technology: Crafting machines, automation, and advanced tools.
  - Sorcery: Spells, rituals, and magical crafting.
- **Complex Building**: Implement a grid-based or freeform building system with snapping and rotation features.
- **RNG for Drops**: Use random number generation to create loot tables for bosses.

### 5. Randomized Map

- Use procedural generation for the map layout, including biomes, resources, and structures.
- Add randomness to ensure replayability.

### 6. AI for Bosses

- Implement AI using behavior trees or state machines for complex boss mechanics.
- Use libraries like **AI-Toolbox** or Unreal's built-in AI system.

### 7. Multiplayer Support

- Use a networking library like **RakNet** or Unreal's networking system to support multiplayer gameplay.

### 8. Development Tools

- Use **CMake** for project configuration and build system management.
- Use **Git** for version control (you already have a repository set up).

## Example Project Structure

/src
  /core         	# Core engine code
  /game         	# Game-specific logic
  /graphics      	# Rendering and voxel engine
  /ai           	# AI for bosses and NPCs
  /networking	# Multiplayer support
/assets         	# Game assets (models, textures, etc.)
/shaders        	# Graphics shaders

## Libraries and Tools

- **Rendering**: OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX.
- **Physics**: Bullet Physics or PhysX.
- **Audio**: OpenAL or FMOD.
- **Scripting**: Lua or Python for modding support.

## Next Steps

1. Decide on the game engine (Unreal Engine is highly recommended for this scope).
2. Start with procedural terrain generation and voxel rendering.
3. Gradually add game mechanics like building, crafting, and AI.
