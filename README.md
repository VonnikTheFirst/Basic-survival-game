# Basic Survival Game

This is my first try at making a basix voxel game with procedural generation, gosses, basicly RPG, survival type game. to thew simmilarity to minecraft and conan exiles.

I want to improve on the aspect of minecraft to add more complexity and depth in the following categories:

> Technology
>
> Complex building
>
> Sorcery (An alternative to technology ~ haven't decided exactly)
>
> More gosses, and more RNG on goss drops

Improve on Conan Exiles:

> Randomized map
>
> Bit less grindy, and available for all people. No matter the playstyle.
